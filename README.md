This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About this project

This was my first web development project that had no direction in where I wanted to go. I was just learning, experimenting and testing everything frontend and backend. The only functionality that still remains is a search feature that allows users to search for any player in the NFL, the ability to create an account using Google Firebase, and login features. You can see all the different ideas I had with this website. From an online portfolio, information scraping and creation of graphics, and sports betting algorithms and statistics. In the end, I ended up scapping this project in pursuit of further opportunities and projects.
